<p>Resource extraction has grown exponentially over the past few decades. As a result, how a company utilizes, manages, plans, and adapts relationships with the natural resources it relies upon to conduct business has become an increasingly important factor for consideration by investors and the public. These factors influence a company&rsquo;s ESG rating and may have a direct impact on the financial capital that is available to it. As a result, investors recognize that risks affecting supply chain pricing and dependency have increased.<span id="_ftnref6" class="note_tooltip">6<span class="tooltip_content">Patwa et al. (2021).</span></span> For example, will the natural resources needed still be available in the long term? The public is also recognizing sustainability as a fundamental and essential issue that can and must be addressed through strong corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review how an organization categorizes its emissions impact across its production cycle and, ultimately, its supply chain. The TCFD recommends that companies in any industry disclose Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. It suggests that &ldquo;even where not material, companies may choose to disclose, as both societal and regulatory expectations around disclosure of this information are increasing.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref7" class="note_tooltip">7<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b).</span></span></p>

<h2>Scope 1 Emissions</h2>
<p>For ESG reporting, Scope 1 emissions are <b>direct emissions</b> (GHG) resulting from a company or organization&rsquo;s behavior.<span id="_ftnref8" class="note_tooltip">8<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b).</span></span> Direct emissions are &ldquo;those emitted from sources owned or controlled by the disclosing entity.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref9" class="note_tooltip">9<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b); EPA (2021a).</span></span> For emission disclosures regulated by legislation, it is recommended that companies disclose emissions as a percentage of the total allowable amount for the emission category.</p>
<p>In summary, if the activities are directly tied to the creation of the good or delivery of the service that is sold by the company, the associated emissions impact would be categorized as a Scope 1 emission. Scope 1 emissions also include impacts as a result of the unintended or accidental activities of a company. For example, an oil or chemical spill that results in an emissions impact would be included in this disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div id="4b_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Scope 2 Emissions</h2>
<p>For ESG reporting, Scope 2 emissions are emissions related to a company or firm&rsquo;s <b>energy management and consumption</b>. They can also be characterized as a source of <b>indirect emissions</b>. Indirect emissions are &ldquo;those emitted from sources not owned or controlled by the disclosing entity but that are emitted as a consequence of the activities of the reporting entity.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref10" class="note_tooltip">10<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b).</span></span> Scope 2 emission disclosures would include items such as heat, electricity, or the production and transportation of the products and/or services provided by the reporting company or organization.</p>
<figure style="max-width: 400px;">
<img id="Picture 5" width="400" src="images/lesson1_image001.png" alt="An illustration depicts the three scopes of emissions. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources on site that emit carbon di-oxide. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from energy or utilities that emit methane. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions of the chain supply or service that emit P C Fs or per-fluorinated compounds. In addition to these emissions S F subscript 6 (Sulphur hexafluoride), N 2 subscript O (nitrous oxide), H C Fs (hydrofluorocarbons) and N F subscript 3 (nitrogen trifluoride) are emitted."/>
</figure>
</div>
<div id="4c_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Scope 3 Emissions</h2>
<p>For ESG reporting, Scope 3 emissions are classified as a company or firm&rsquo;s <b>indirect emissions</b>. These are related to &ldquo;product design,&rdquo; &ldquo;supply chain management,&rdquo; and &ldquo;materials sourcing and efficiency.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref11" class="note_tooltip">11<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b).</span></span> They include all activities both upstream and downstream from the reporting company or organization&rsquo;s activities. For example, when Ford purchases supplies that are used in its production process, the emissions created by the vendor that Ford purchased supplies from would be considered Scope 3 emissions for Ford. An interesting insight here is that Scope 1 emissions for one firm (a producer) can be Scope 3 emissions for another firm (a buyer in the supply chain). Scope 3 disclosures are important for investors as they help identify whether a company is adapting its business strategies to manage climate-related risks and opportunities. This allows investors to determine whether a company is &ldquo;well-positioned to meet evolving and increasingly stringent energy efficiency standards, to capture growing demand for energy-efficient products, and/or to enable and incentivize upstream emissions reductions.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref12" class="note_tooltip">12<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2020b).</span></span></p>
<p>The diagram above provides a comprehensive understanding of the creation of Scope 1 direct emissions by the reporting entity as well as the Scope 2 and 3 indirect emissions resulting from both upstream and downstream reporting entity activities. Some of these activities are discussed in more detail in the next section.</p>

<h2>GHG Emissions</h2>
<p>GHG emission disclosures include a company&rsquo;s <b>Scope 1</b> or <b>direct</b> emissions generated by conducting business. They include emissions from stationary and mobile sources (factories, delivery vehicles). This category also includes the &ldquo;management of regulatory risks, environmental compliance, and reputational risks and opportunities, as they related to direct GHG emissions.&rdquo;<span id="_ftnref13" class="note_tooltip">13<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2022).</span></span></p>
<p>The seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol and within required disclosures of GHG emissions are the following: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>).</p>
</div>
<div id="5b_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Air Quality</h2>
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>Separate from GHG emissions, air quality disclosures address a company&rsquo;s management of impacts on air quality resulting from the conduct of business. They include mobile and stationary sources, as well as a company&rsquo;s industrial emissions, and might include a company or organization&rsquo;s Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2, and Scope 3 (indirect) impacts on air quality.</p>
<p>Common airborne pollutants included in ESG reporting on air quality include but are not limited to oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, particulate matter, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<div id="5c_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Energy Management</h2>
<p>This category of issues concerns itself with the environmental impacts of a company&rsquo;s energy consumption and management of energy used to provide products and services. It includes but is not limited to disclosures on energy efficiency and intensity; energy sources used; and a company&rsquo;s reliance on the grid.<span id="_ftnref14" class="note_tooltip">14<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2022).</span></span> Energy management, particularly that related to purchased electricity and heating/cooling of a company or organization, would be included in Scope 2 emission disclosures.</p>
</div>
<div id="5d_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Water and Wastewater Management</h2>
<p>Waste and wastewater management issues focus on a company&rsquo;s water use and consumption, and the impact of its business operations on water resources. They include information on a company&rsquo;s wastewater generation and management strategies, specifically water efficiency, intensity, and recycling. These issues might include regional differences in availability/quality/competition for water resources and how a company will manage these risks.<span id="_ftnref15" class="note_tooltip">15<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2022).</span></span> A company or organization&rsquo;s water and waste management is typically included in Scope 3 emission disclosures.</p>
</div>
<div id="5e_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Waste and Hazardous Materials Management</h2>
<p>This management of waste and hazardous materials has important environmental implications. This category addresses the company&rsquo;s management of solid wastes in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industrial processes and includes the treatment, handling, storage, disposal, and regulatory compliance of its management of waste and hazardous materials.<span id="_ftnref16" class="note_tooltip">16<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2022).</span></span> As with water waste, a company or organization&rsquo;s waste management is typically included in Scope 3 emission disclosures.</p>
</div>
<div id="5f_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Ecological Impacts</h2>
<p>This category highlights a company&rsquo;s conduct related to its business operations and the subsequent impact upon ecosystems and biodiversity. It includes, but is not limited to, a company&rsquo;s land use and natural resource use, as well as ecological impacts like biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, and deforestation at all stages or levels of activity of the company or organization.<span id="_ftnref17" class="note_tooltip">17<span class="tooltip_content">SASB (2022).</span></span> This area of reporting would also include a company&rsquo;s plans to mitigate impacts and engage in site remediation.</p>
</div>
<div id="5g_text" class="exploreText">
<h2>Supply Chain</h2>
<p>For ESG reporting purposes, the Environmental pillar also encompasses issues related to the overall supply chain. Supply chain issues are included in a company or organization&rsquo;s Scope 3 emission disclosures. Reporting requires companies or organizations to identify, plan, and create strategies to mitigate environmental (and social) impacts along their supply chains. Many companies report on these issues and how they align with the UN SDGs. It is important to note that the capturing and compilation of Scope 3 emissions data is particularly difficult. Vendors do not readily provide this information within the overall supply chain, which means that producers have to estimate their Scope 3 emissions. The risk is that those estimates are inaccurate, which defeats the purpose of reporting the data in the first place.</p>

	<p>A company&rsquo;s reporting on its carbon footprint is usually included within its annual GHG (greenhouse gas) disclosures. GHG emission inventories include information and data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions due to a company or organization&rsquo;s direct and indirect actions. Many companies globally disclose emission information in alignment with the reporting framework that they have chosen to follow and the related requirements. GHG reporting is often presented in stand-alone reports, annual ESG reports, and a company&rsquo;s annual financial reports.</p>
